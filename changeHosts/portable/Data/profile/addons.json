In some cases developers needs to take care of thousands lines divided by several files. Everytime a server needs a different IP is a very boring job to update all these files.\n\nWith this problem in mind, we've created Change Hosts. A very easy to use tool that can make this job more efficient.\n\nLearn more about it here: http://www.coders.com.br/change-hosts\n\nGreat with DNS Flusher: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dns-flusher","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/121/121497.png?src=api&modified=1388527485","width":"666","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/121/121497.png?src=api&modified=1388527485","thumbnailWidth":"190","thumbnailHeight":"150"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/121/121496.png?src=api&modified=1388527485","width":"666","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/121/121496.png?src=api&modified=1388527485","thumbnailWidth":"190","thumbnailHeight":"150"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/121/121494.png?src=api&modified=1388527485","width":"460","height":"400","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/121/121494.png?src=api&modified=1388527485","thumbnailWidth":"173","thumbnailHeight":"150"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/121/121502.png?src=api&modified=1388527485","width":"460","height":"200","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/121/121502.png?src=api&modified=1388527485","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"87"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/121/121493.png?src=api&modified=1388527485","width":"460","height":"200","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/121/121493.png?src=api&modified=1388527485","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"87"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/121/121501.png?src=api&modified=1388527485","width":"460","height":"200","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/121/121501.png?src=api&modified=1388527485","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"87"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/121/121495.png?src=api&modified=1388527485","width":"460","height":"200","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/121/121495.png?src=api&modified=1388527485","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"87"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/121/121498.png?src=api&modified=1388527485","width":"460","height":"200","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/121/121498.png?src=api&modified=1388527485","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"87"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/121/121500.png?src=api&modified=1388527485","width":"460","height":"200","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/121/121500.png?src=api&modified=1388527485","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"87"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/121/121499.png?src=api&modified=1388527485","width":"594","height":"300","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/121/121499.png?src=api&modified=1388527485","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"101"}],"averageRating":4,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/change-hosts/?src=api","homepageURL":"http://www.coders.com.br/change-hosts","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/239344/change_hosts-4.0.2-fx.xpi?src=api","size":92602,"contributionURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/change-hosts/developers?src=api","contributionAmount":"$5.00","developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/change-hosts/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":16,"totalDownloads":42754,"weeklyDownloads":139,"dailyUsers":3400,"updateDate":1389912561000,"supportURL":"http://www.coders.com.br/change-hosts"}]}
